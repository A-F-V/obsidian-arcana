# Mission:

1. To amplify human thinking by expanding the medium of thought beyond the human mind.

# Project End Goals:

Each note is a unit of thought which evolves over time. By **interacting** with a note, we think and put more work into it.
The goal is to improve the **Human-Media Interaction (HMI)** with notes so that the overall **notescape** may flourish. This is achieved by **creating a plugin system for augmenting and adding new HMIs**.

# Categories:

-   Space Repetition
-   Auto Linking
-   Efficient Search (similiarity search)

(Then collections of notes form bigger themes and ideas. These collections are lifted through tags.)
